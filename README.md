# Minimum-gRPC-ImGUI-ClientServerTEMPLATE

This repository is still in the making. It can already be used but SETUP.sh is not yet functional and should not yet be run.
This means the setup has to be done manualy. A documentation for that will be provided within the next weeks. (but don't be afraid to use this template; the code and structure should be pretty straight forward;)
